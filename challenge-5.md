# Challenge 5

## a) What results differ from Nikto? Explain them.

      - Openvas provides a GUI to scan a target host with a dashboard to easily analyze 
      any vulnerabilities that may appear while nikto scans for vulnerabilities in a target 
      host using the CLI. Nikto scans webservers for dangerous files, outdated server software,
      and other problems while the Openvas framework utilizes several tools to scan for vulnerabilities
      such as CVEs and NVTs.
